I have the following data frame:

Date     Value1   Value2
01-01-01     01       01
02-01-01     02       00
03-01-01     03       01
04-01-01     04      101
On this data frame I would like to select just the rows having Value2==0 and Value2>=100

For that, I use the following command:

data.loc[(data['Value2'] == 0) & (data['Value2'] >= 100)]
Which return me an empty DataFrame. I don't really understand why because when I used separately:

data.loc[(data['Value2'] == 0)]
or:

data.loc[(data['Value2'] >= 100)
It returns the corrected values. Does anyone knows how to implement this 2 conditions selection?

python pandas loc
